            My name is <b>Taru</b>.I was born in the small town of <em>Pathankot</em>. I did my 10th standard from Ranchi and 12th standard from Mumbai. I have been to many places but the one I like the most out of all must be <em>Mumbai</em>.
        </p>

            Life in Mumbai is incomparable. I think its not the big city vibes or the people. It is about the peace in the chaos, the calm in the storm. Living there has made life so much easier. Life in easy terms is <b>comfortable</b>. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am a second year student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. 
            Coming back to a small town again was not easy for a change but I am pretty good at adapting to new environments and I have done pretty well coming in terms with the college. 
            I love exploring new things and finding <em>creative</em> solutions to problems. I am <strong>passionate</strong> about designing and artificial intelligence. 
            Currently I am exploring development using python, in which I am exploring web frameworks and interfaces like Django, Tkinter. I have also worked with libraries like StreamLit, Numpy and Pandas.
